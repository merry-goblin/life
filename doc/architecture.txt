*** Class types ***

Controller : 

	This class is used to launch a program. It initializes object and it is the start point of any cycle.
	This class is only a disptacher and has no skill at all, to do something, a service has to be called.

Element :

	Elements represent a specific object in the program. 
	An element has no function associated. It has got only properties describing itself.
	There is elements of many kind but the main ones are entities and interactions.
	An entity is a persistant object (ex: synapse) while an interaction is a short-live object (ex: action potential).

Service - Graphic :

	Anything related to display has to be in this class.

Service - Handler (static) :

	A handler purpose is to handle an element to build, add, remove or get. 
	It provides any basic treatment you need to do on an element without any business logic.

Service - Listener :

	All classes need to communicate with others at some point. 
	To achieve this goal a listener is the perfect tool.
	A listener has got a list of events on which ones a method can listen and another one can trigger.
	If a graphic service want to know when an action potential is created it will listen on the "add" event of the action potential listener.
	When a class create an action potential this class will trigger an "add" event on the action potential listener.

Service - Manager :

	Business logic is in thoses classes. 
	Any business logic which could be put in a controller should be put in a manager. 
	A controller has to dispatch only.
