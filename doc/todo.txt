1. Calcul of post-synaptic potentials must be changed :

- Keep a link between a post-synaptic potential and his synapse
- Count number of neurotransmitters thrown When a presynaptic button is activated
- Change permeability according to the number of neurotransmitters still present in synapse
- Remove disolution on post-synaptic potentials
- Decrease number of neurotransmitters in a synapse over time
- Calculate current potential of a post-synaptic potential according to permability of ionic channels

2. Modelise refractory period
