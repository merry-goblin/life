1. Calcul of post-synaptic potentials must be changed :

Note : The way we calculate membrane potential is changed.
We do not cumulate local potentials anymore (is not a real behavior) 
All calcul will be done through goldmann equation, only constants will change

- [done] Keep a link between a post-synaptic potential and his synapse
- [done] Synapse activation takes time to generate a postsynaptic potential (2ms ?)
- Count number of neurotransmitters thrown when a presynaptic button is activated
- Change permeability according to the number of neurotransmitters still present in synapse
- Remove disolution on post-synaptic potentials
- Decrease number of neurotransmitters in a synapse over time
- Calculate current potential of a post-synaptic potential according to permability of ionic channels

2. Modelise refractory period

-

3. Allow setting modification since user interface

- Concentrations of neurotransmitter intra and extra

4. Unit testing

- services/calculs/analytic-geometry.js : ok
- services/calculs/arithmetic.js : ok
- services/calculs/membrane-potential.js : ok
